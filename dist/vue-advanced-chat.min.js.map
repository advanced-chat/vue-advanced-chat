This is because the block\n type of the previous granule can only be determined\n after we have computed the psycho acoustics for the following\n granule.\n\n Output:  maskings and energies for each scalefactor band.\n block type, PE, and some correlation measures.\n The PE is used by CBR modes to determine if extra bits\n from the bit reservoir should be used.  The correlation\n measures are used to determine mid/side or regular stereo.\n */\n/*\n Notation:\n\n barks:  a non-linear frequency scale.  Mapping from frequency to\n barks is given by freq2bark()\n\n scalefactor bands: The spectrum (frequencies) are broken into\n SBMAX \"scalefactor bands\".  Thes bands\n are determined by the MPEG ISO spec.  In\n the noise shaping/quantization code, we allocate\n bits among the partition bands to achieve the\n best possible quality\n\n partition bands:   The spectrum is also broken into about\n 64 \"partition bands\".  Each partition\n band is about .34 barks wide.  There are about 2-5\n partition bands for each scalefactor band.\n\n LAME computes all psycho acoustic information for each partition\n band.  Then at the end of the computations, this information\n is mapped to scalefactor bands.  The energy in each scalefactor\n band is taken as the sum of the energy in all partition bands\n which overlap the scalefactor band.  The maskings can be computed\n in the same way (and thus represent the average masking in that band)\n or by taking the minmum value multiplied by the number of\n partition bands used (which represents a minimum masking in that band).\n */\n/*\n The general outline is as follows:\n\n 1. compute the energy in each partition band\n 2. compute the tonality in each partition band\n 3. compute the strength of each partion band \"masker\"\n 4. compute the masking (via the spreading function applied to each masker)\n 5. Modifications for mid/side masking.\n\n Each partition band is considiered a \"masker\".  The strength\n of the i'th masker in band j is given by:\n\n s3(bark(i)-bark(j))*strength(i)\n\n The strength of the masker is a function of the energy and tonality.\n The more tonal, the less masking.  LAME uses a simple linear formula\n (controlled by NMT and TMN) which says the strength is given by the\n energy divided by a linear function of the tonality.\n */\n/*\n s3() is the \"spreading function\".  It is given by a formula\n determined via listening tests.\n\n The total masking in the j'th partition band is the sum over\n all maskings i.  It is thus given by the convolution of\n the strength with s3(), the \"spreading function.\"\n\n masking(j) = sum_over_i  s3(i-j)*strength(i)  = s3 o strength\n\n where \"o\" = convolution operator.  s3 is given by a formula determined\n via listening tests.  It is normalized so that s3 o 1 = 1.\n\n Note: instead of a simple convolution, LAME also has the\n option of using \"additive masking\"\n\n The most critical part is step 2, computing the tonality of each\n partition band.  LAME has two tonality estimators.  The first\n is based on the ISO spec, and measures how predictiable the\n signal is over time.  The more predictable, the more tonal.\n The second measure is based on looking at the spectrum of\n a single granule.  The more peaky the spectrum, the more\n tonal.  By most indications, the latter approach is better.\n\n Finally, in step 5, the maskings for the mid and side\n channel are possibly increased.  Under certain circumstances,\n noise in the mid & side channels is assumed to also\n be masked by strong maskers in the L or R channels.\n\n\n Other data computed by the psy-model:\n\n ms_ratio        side-channel / mid-channel masking ratio (for previous granule)\n ms_ratio_next   side-channel / mid-channel masking ratio for this granule\n\n percep_entropy[2]     L and R values (prev granule) of PE - A measure of how\n much pre-echo is in the previous granule\n percep_entropy_MS[2]  mid and side channel values (prev granule) of percep_entropy\n energy[4]             L,R,M,S energy in each channel, prev granule\n blocktype_d[2]        block type to use for previous granule\n */\n//package mp3;\n\n//import java.util.Arrays;\nvar common = require('./common.js');\nvar System = common.System;\nvar VbrMode = common.VbrMode;\nvar Float = common.Float;\nvar ShortBlock = common.ShortBlock;\nvar Util = common.Util;\nvar Arrays = common.Arrays;\nvar new_array_n = common.new_array_n;\nvar new_byte = common.new_byte;\nvar new_double = common.new_double;\nvar new_float = common.new_float;\nvar new_float_n = common.new_float_n;\nvar new_int = common.new_int;\nvar new_int_n = common.new_int_n;\nvar assert = common.assert;\n\nvar FFT = require(\"./FFT.js\");\nvar Encoder = require(\"./Encoder.js\");\n\nfunction PsyModel() {\n\n    var fft = new FFT();\n\n    var LOG10 = 2.30258509299404568402;\n\n    var rpelev = 2;\n    var rpelev2 = 16;\n    var rpelev_s = 2;\n    var rpelev2_s = 16;\n\n    /* size of each partition band, in barks: */\n    var DELBARK = .34;\n\n    /* tuned for output level (sensitive to energy scale) */\n    var VO_SCALE = (1. / (14752 * 14752) / (Encoder.BLKSIZE / 2));\n\n    var temporalmask_sustain_sec = 0.01;\n\n    var NS_PREECHO_ATT0 = 0.8;\n    var NS_PREECHO_ATT1 = 0.6;\n    var NS_PREECHO_ATT2 = 0.3;\n\n    var NS_MSFIX = 3.5;\n\n    var NSATTACKTHRE = 4.4;\n    var NSATTACKTHRE_S = 25;\n\n    var NSFIRLEN = 21;\n\n    /* size of each partition band, in barks: */\n    var LN_TO_LOG10 = 0.2302585093;\n\n    function NON_LINEAR_SCALE_ENERGY(x) {\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * <PRE>\n     *       L3psycho_anal.
